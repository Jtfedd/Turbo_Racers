Career mode

In career mode, there is an explanation of the current race,
a button to start the next race, and a garage button to enter the
garage (where you can update your ship).  You can ONLY do the CURRENT
race in career mode. If you want to replay a previous race, you must use
single player mode.

Garage

In the garage, you can buy upgrades for your ship(s). Click the corresponding 
button to purchase an upgrade. Upgrades are automatically used in career 
mode, optionally used in single player mode, and never used in multiplayer 
mode.
