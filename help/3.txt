Single Player Mode

In single player mode, simply choose the
options for the race you want and then click
race. You can choose options such as whether
or not you use upgrades you have bought in
career mode, and how many computer players
you race. Explore this mode to discover all of
its features.

Multiplayer Mode

Same as Single Player, exept that you choose
two cars, and race splitscreen with a friend.
You cannot use upgrades in multiplayer mode.
